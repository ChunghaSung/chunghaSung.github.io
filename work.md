- <b>Instruction Constraint Verifier</b>: 
I worked on building a SMT-based constraints verifier for instruction-set under various architectures.
Broadly, I focused on checking the inconsistency of constraints written by designers.
- <b>Integration of Fuzz-testing</b>:
This is not a complete project, but I tried to integrate fuzz-testing into a testing process for 
insturction implementations.

- <b>Extension of a Scope query optimization tool</b>:
During the internship at MSR, I extended a scope query optimization tool. 
The tool consists of two parts: one part is parser and another part is template generation. 
Basically, it parses a query file and then prints a C-style code template, 
and the template is fed into a programming synthesis tool to optimize it. 
Then, the optimized C-style program is translated into an optimized query. 
However, the tool only supported a small set of queries because many queries 
use many combinations of columns and uninterpreted functions. So, I have 
changed both parser and template generation parts. To achieve this, I got used to F#, C# and Scope query.

- <b>Development of Boot loader sequence</b>: 
During the internship at AhnLab, I worked on prototyping new boot loader 
for an appliance that should be compatible with x86/MIPS architecture 
and Linux-based operating systems and simplified customer support 
and troubleshooting, ensuring that the boot loader would provide 
multi-level booting, securing the system to protect not only back 
side information, but customersâ€™ information as well.
